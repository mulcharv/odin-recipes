        <h2>Steps</h2>
        <ol>
            <li><strong>KIDS the writing in bold is for you.</strong> ADULTS the rest is for you. TO MAKE SUSHI ROLLS: <strong>Pat out some rice.</strong> Lay a nori sheet on the mat, shiny-side down. Dip your hands in the vinegared water, then pat handfuls of rice on top in a 1cm thick layer, leaving the furthest edge from you clear.</li>
            <li><strong>Spread over some Japanese mayonnaise.</strong> Use a spoon to spread out a thin layer of mayonnaise down the middle of the rice.</li>
            <li><strong>Add the filling.</strong> Get your child to top the mayonnaise with a line of their favourite fillings, here we've used tuna and cucumber.</li>
            <li><strong>Roll it up.</strong> Lift the edge of the mat over the rice, applying a little pressure to keep everything in a tight roll.</li>
            <li><strong>Stick down the sides like a stamp.</strong> When you get to the edge without any rice, brush with a little water and continue to roll into a tight roll.</li>
            <li><strong>Wrap in cling film.</strong> Remove the mat and roll tightly in cling film before a grown-up cuts the sushi into thick slices, then unravel the cling film.</li>
            <li>TO MAKE PRESSED SUSHI: <strong>Layer over some smoked salmon.</strong> Line a loaf tin with cling film, then place a thin layer of smoked salmon inside on top of the cling film.</li>
            <li><strong>Cover with rice and press down.</strong> Press about 3cm of rice over the fish, fold the cling film over and press down as much as you can, using another tin if you have one.</li>
            <li><strong>Tip it out like a sandcastle.</strong> Turn block of sushi onto a chopping board. Get a grown-up to cut into fingers, then remove the cling film.</li>
            <li>TO MAKE SUSHI BALLS: <strong>Choose your topping.</strong> Get a small square of cling film and place a topping, like half a prawn or a small piece of smoked salmon, on it. Use damp hands to roll walnut-sized balls of rice and place on the topping.</li>
            <li><strong>Make into tight balls.</strong> Bring the corners of the cling film together and tighten into balls by twisting it up, then unwrap and serve.</li>
        </ol>
